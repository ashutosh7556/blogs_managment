The alpines problem like
:-$wire not define
:-multiple alpines
:-settable not define etc..

Solution for that :-we were  using Livewire Tables v3, but parts of your setup were based on instructions or assumptions from v2, which is not compatible with the v3 structure.
The Livewire Tables v3 package relies on automatic asset injection, not manual imports like before.


1. Wrong JS import path (v2 path used)	You added this to resources/js/app.js:
:-import '../../vendor/rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables/resources/js/laravel-livewire-tables.js';


2 Assets not being injected by package	In config/livewire-tables.php, the asset flags were either missing or false:

:-  php<br>'inject_core_assets_enabled' => false,<br>'inject_third_party_assets_enabled' => false<br>
  (this is inside the config->livewire-table.php)
:-This stopped Livewire Tables from loading the necessary JS helper file.

3. Two Alpines loaded	You were likely loading Alpine twice:
 – Once from Livewire
 – Once manually or via another package
 This broke $wire, caused <x-data> not to work, and gave the warning: “Detected multiple instances of Alpine running”	Alpine directives failed. Nothing reactive worked.
