What us Socket.io ?
=>socket Io is real time communication libarary .it allows instant messaging between server and client like(like chatting,notification,live updates).
it uses websocket (and fallback options)to keep persistent connection between client and server

Why use the Socket.io in laravel  ?
=>Laravel is PHP-based,and by default ,PHP is not persistent it proccess a request and ends .But in real-time apps need presistent connections.
So we use :-
-Laravel for backend logic(authentication,storing massage)
-Node.js +Socke.io to handle real-time-messaging
-Optional:Redis as a bridge between laravel ans Node.js


Tools we will Need
1-Laravel(backend)
2-Node.js+Socket.io(Real-time-serve)
3-Redis use to broadcaster
4-Laravel Echo( Client-Side JS library for listening)
5-Broadcasting setup in Laravel

High lavel flow of chat system
1-User type ans send a message(Frontend)
2-Laravel receives and stores in the Db.
3-Laravel Broadcaste the message using the an event
4-Node.js + Socket.io picks up the events and pushes into the client
5-All Connected users instantly see the new message


Step-by-Step: Simple Chat with Laravel + Socket.IO
1. ğŸ§± Install Laravel + Setup Broadcast
>composer require predis/predis

In .env:
BROADCAST_DRIVER=redis
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis

@Cheaking the status of websoket is working or not :-
