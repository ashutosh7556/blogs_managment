#Core Concep:=>
Alpine.js use special HTML attributes that starts with the x-.These add behavior to your element
here the most Important ones.

Alpine Attributes :=>
x-data ->	Declares component state (variables)6tya

x-show  ->	Shows/hides elements:-. It provides an expressive way to show and hide DOM elements.

x-bind(or :) ->	Binds attributes dynamically :-x-bind allows you to set HTML attributes on elements based on the result of JavaScript expressions.

x-on (or @)->	Listens for events (like clicks):-x-on allows you to easily run code on dispatched DOM events.

x-text -> sets the text content of an element to the result of a given expression.

x-html -> sets the "innerHTML" property of an element to the result of a given expression.

x-model ->Two-way binding (e.g., form inputs)-:x-model allows you to bind the value of an input element to Alpine data.means x-model is two-way bound, meaning it both "sets" and "gets"

x-if ->	Conditionally render elements

x-transition ->	Animates showing/hiding

x-teleport ->The x-teleport directive allows you to transport part of your Alpine template to another part of the DOM on the page entirely.


Example:-
< div x-data ="{open:false}">
<button @click="Open" =!open">Toggle menu </button>
<div x-show="open">
    <p>This is the menu!</p>
  </div>
</div>


 Whatâ€™s happening here:=>
 :-x-data="{ open: false }" defines a variable called open
 :-@click="open = !open" toggles open when you click the button
 :-x-show="open" shows the menu when open is true-
